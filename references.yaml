    Summary
                
                  1.
                   In this essay I summarize current trends in the evolutionary ecology of plant defence, while advocating for approaches that integrate community ecology with specific tests of classic evolutionary hypotheses. Several conclusions emerge.
                
                
                  2.
                   The microevolution of defence is perhaps best studied by reciprocal transplant experiments of differentiated plant populations while simultaneously manipulating the presence of the herbivore(s) hypothesized to be the agent(s) of natural selection.
                
                
                  3.
                  Although there is continued interest in the costs of defence, I argue that some empirical approaches to estimating costs (e.g. genetic engineering) may provide limited insight into evolutionary processes.
                
                
                  4.
                   Essentially all plants employ several different lines of defence against herbivory. It is thus time to abandon searching for single silver bullet traits and the simple trade‐off model (where traits are arbitrarily expected to negatively covary across genotypes or species). We still know very little about which trait combinations are most effective and have repeatedly evolved together. Thus, some of our prominent theories (e.g. a predicted trade‐off between direct and indirect defence) need to be revised.
                
                
                  5.
                   Studies of the macroevolution of plant defence are enjoying renewed interest due to available phylogenies and analytical methods. Although general trends are not currently surmisable, we will soon have strong case studies evaluating both biotic and abiotic drivers of convergent evolution in defence strategies and the role of defence evolution in the adaptive radiation of plant lineages.
                
                
                  6.
                   The evolution of specificity is proposed as a final frontier in understanding complexity in plant–herbivore interactions. Although it is abundantly clear that plants can deploy highly specific defensive responses that are differentially perceived by herbivore species, how such responses evolve and are physiologically regulated remains an important gap. Relatively straightforward methodologies are now available to close the loop between plant perception of herbivory, hormonal responses, and production of defensive end‐products across genotype or species.

    The analysis of plant–pathogen interactions is a rapidly moving research
    field and one that is very important for productive agricultural systems.
    The focus of this review is on the evolution of plant defence responses and
    the coevolution of their pathogens, primarily from a molecular-genetic
    perspective. It explores the evolution of the major types of plant defence
    responses including pathogen associated molecular patterns and effector
    triggered immunity as well as the forces driving pathogen evolution, such as
    the mechanisms by which pathogen lineages and species evolve. Advances in
    our understanding of plant defence signalling, stomatal regulation, R
    gene–effector interactions and host specific toxins are used to highlight
    recent insights into the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and
    plants. Finally, the review considers the intriguing question of how plants
    have evolved the ability to distinguish friends such as rhizobia and
    mycorrhiza from their many foes.

    PERMANOVA is a computer program for testing the simultaneous response of one
    or more variables to one or more factors in an ANOVA experimental design on
    the basis of any distance measure, using permutation methods. These notes
    for users assume knowledge of multi-factorial ANOVA, which has the same
    basic logic in multivariate as in univariate analysis, and an understanding
    of what it means to test a multivariate hypothesis. A more complete
    description of the method is given in Anderson (2001a) and McArdle &
    Anderson (2001). The program includes: choice of appropriate transformation
    and/or standardization of the data; choice of 19 distance (or dissimilarity)
    measures to use as the basis of the analysis; option to rank the distances
    in the distance matrix before the analysis; analysis and partitioning of the
    total sum of squares according to the full model, including appropriate
    treatment of factors that are fixed or random, crossed (orthogonal) or
    nested (hierarchical), and all interaction terms; correct calculation of an
    appropriate distance-based pseudo F-statistic for each term in the model,
    based on expected mean squares as in univariate ANOVA (Winer et al. 1991,
    Searle et al.1992); correct permutation procedures to obtain P-values for
    each term in the model, using the correct permutable units (Anderson & ter
    Braak 2003); choice of permutation method: raw data units or residuals under
    either a reduced or a full model (Anderson 2001b, Anderson & Legendre 1999,
    Anderson & Robinson 2001); correct P-values also obtained through Monte
    Carlo random draws from the asymptotic permutation distribution (Anderson &
    Robinson 2003); option to include one or more covariables (i.e., to perform
    ANCOVA or MANCOVA); pair-wise a posteriori comparisons of levels for single
    factors, including within individual levels of other factors in the case of
    significant interactions and the use of correct permutable units in each
    case.

    Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues
    without causing disease. Endophytes have been found in every plant species
    examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of
    fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of
    central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness,
    host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two
    co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and
    Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by
    endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347
    genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single
    isolate (59%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf
    (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial
    heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence
    records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes
    themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that
    exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.

  abstract: >-
    Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its
    asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes rep-resent a ubiquitous,
    yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes
    associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet,
    fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In
    contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically
    transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the
    diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angio-sperms are
    thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high
    diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes
    associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland
    Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with
    endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts
    signifi-cantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao
    seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In
    contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we
    found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues.
    Further, endophyte-mediated protec-tion was greater in mature leaves, which
    bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves.
    In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry,
    and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes
    with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of
    diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an
    important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.

    Drought strongly influences plant phenology, growth and mortality in
    tropical forests, thereby shaping plant performance, population dynamics and
    community structure (Bunker & Carson 2005, Condit
                  et al.
                  1995). Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (Lösch & Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant–fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997). In contrast, rhizosphere mutualists such as ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may benefit hosts by increasing surface area for water uptake, enhancing stomatal regulation of water loss, and increasing root hydraulic conductivity (Auge 2001, Lösch & Gansert 2002).

    SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for
    controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has
    faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
    significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
    proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This
    error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
    smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false
    discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential
    for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved
    to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
    simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the
    new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with
    examples.

    Our study examines how the mutualism between Atta colombica leaf-cutting
    ants and their cultivated fungus is influenced by the presence of diverse
    foliar endophytic fungi (endophytes) at high densities in tropical leaf
    tissues. We conducted laboratory choice trials in which ant colonies chose
    between Cordia alliodora seedlings with high (E high) or low (E low)
    densities of endophytes. The E high seedlings contained 5.5 times higher
    endophyte content and a greater diversity of fungal morphospecies than the E
    low treatment, and endophyte content was not correlated with leaf toughness
    or thickness. Leafcutting ants cut over 2.5 times the leaf area from E low
    relative to E high seedlings and had a tendency to recruit more ants to E
    low plants. Our findings suggest that leaf-cutting ants may incur costs from
    cutting and processing leaves with high endophyte loads, which could impact
    Neotropical forests by causing variable damage rates within plant
    communities. This journal is ? 2010 The Royal Society.

    This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory
    variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical
    forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I
    error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting
    these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful
    method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a
    two‐step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is
    carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can
    proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained
    variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping
    criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted
    coefficient of multiple determination (
                  
                    
                  
                  ) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.

    Fungal communities associated with plants often decrease in similarity as
    the distance between sampling sites increases (i.e., they demonstrate
    distance decay). In the southwestern USA, forests occur in highlands
    separated from one another by warmer, drier biomes with plant and fungal
    communities that differ from those at higher elevations. These disjunct
    forests are broadly similar in climate to one another, offering an
    opportunity to examine drivers of distance decay in plant-associated fungi
    across multiple ecologically similar yet geographically disparate
    landscapes. We examined ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi
    associated with a dominant forest tree (Pinus ponderosa) in forests across
    ca. 550 km of geographic distance from northwestern to southeastern Arizona
    (USA). Both guilds of fungi showed distance decay, but drivers differed for
    each: ectomycorrhizal fungi are constrained primarily by dispersal
    limitation, whereas foliar endophytes are constrained by specific
    environmental conditions. Most ectomycorrhizal fungi were found in only a
    single forested area, as were many endophytic fungi. Such regional-scale
    perspectives are needed for baseline estimates of fungal diversity
    associated with forest trees at a landscape scale, with attention to the
    sensitivity of different guilds of fungal symbionts to decreasing areas of
    suitable habitat, increasing disturbance, and related impacts of climate
    change.

    Motivation: High-quality phylogenetic placement of sequence data has the
    potential to greatly accelerate studies of the diversity, systematics,
    ecology and functional biology of diverse groups. We developed the
    Tree-Based Alignment Selector (T-BAS) toolkit to allow evolutionary
    placement and visualization of diverse DNA sequences representing unknown
    taxa within a robust phylogenetic context, and to permit the downloading of
    highly curated, single- and multi-locus alignments for specific clades.
    Results: In its initial form, T-BAS v1.0 uses a core phylogeny of 979 taxa
    (including 23 outgroup taxa, as well as 61 orders, 175 families and 496
    genera) representing all 13 classes of largest subphylum of Fungi -
    Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota) - based on sequence alignments for six loci
    (nr5.8S, nrLSU, nrSSU, mtSSU, RPB1, RPB2). T-BAS v1.0 has three main uses:
    (i) Users may download alignments and voucher tables for members of the
    Pezizomycotina directly from the reference tree, facilitating systematics
    studies of focal clades. (ii) Users may upload sequence files with reads
    representing unknown taxa and place these on the phylogeny using either
    BLAST or phylogeny-based approaches, and then use the displayed tree to
    select reference taxa to include when downloading alignments. The placement
    of unknowns can be performed for large numbers of Sanger sequences obtained
    from fungal cultures and for alignable, short reads of environmental
    amplicons. (iii) User-customizable metadata can be visualized on the tree.

    Summary
                
                  1.
                   Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life‐history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood.
                
                
                  2.
                   We conducted a meta‐analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families.
                
                
                  3.
                   Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life‐history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity).
                
                
                  4.
                   These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti‐herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life‐history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.

    Plant and microorganisms actively communicate through chemical entities.
              , 
                Microorganisms are found everywhere, and they are closely associated with plants. Because the establishment of any plant–microbe association involves chemical communication, understanding crosstalk processes is fundamental to defining the type of relationship. Although several metabolites from plants and microbes have been fully characterized, their roles in the chemical interplay between these partners are not well understood in most cases, and they require further investigation. In this review, we describe different plant–microbe associations from colonization to microbial establishment processes in plants along with future prospects, including agricultural benefits.

    Endophytic fungi live symbiotically in the tissues of plants. Although a
    large amount of evidence suggests a mutualistic role for vertically
    transmitted endophytic fungi in agronomic grasses, the role of horizontally
    transmitted endophytic fungi as mutualists has been challenged. Recent
    studies, however, have shown that horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi
    can act as mutualists to their plant hosts by providing defense against
    pathogens and defoliators. In particular, several experimental studies have
    shown that endophytic fungi interact negatively with leaf-cutting ants and
    their fungal cultivar, but these studies were performed under laboratory
    conditions. Using field colonies of Atta colombica in Central Panama, we
    measured the fungal endophyte content in the forage material of leaf-cutting
    ants and compared it to ambient endophyte levels. We then used the collected
    data to model the area of plant material containing endophytes that enters a
    mature colony daily. We found that mature colonies collect leaf material
    that is 20% lower in endophyte abundance than surrounding leaves. A similar
    pattern was observed for newly emerged colonies. Our model suggests that via
    ant foraging preferences, leaf-cutting ants reduce the possible area of
    material containing endophytes entering the colony by 33%. Our results
    provide further evidence for a negative interaction between leaf-cutting
    ants and horizontally transmitted endophytes, suggesting that fungal
    endophytes have a defensive role in tropical plants by influencing
    leafcutting ant foraging preferences. Copyright: ? 2013 Coblentz and Van

    In recent years there has been significant attention paid on the endophytic
    research by various groups working within this domain. Mutualistic
    endophytic microbes with an emphasis on the relatively understudied fungal
    endophytes are the focus of this special book. Plants are associated with
    micro-organisms: endophytic bacteria and fungi, which live inter- and
    intra-cellularly without inducing pathogenic symptoms, but have active
    biochemical and genetic interactions with their host. Endophytes play vital
    roles as plant growth promoters, biocontrol agents, biosurfactant producers,
    enzymes and secondary metabolite producers, as well as providing a new
    hidden repertoire of bioactive natural products with uses in pharmaceutical,
    agrochemical and other biotechnological applications. The increasing
    interest in endophytic research generates significant progress in our
    understanding of the host-endophyte relationship at molecular and genetic
    level. The bio-prospection of microbial endophytes has led to exciting
    possibilities for their biotechnological application as biocontrol agent,
    bioactive metabolites, and other useful traits. Apart from these virtues,
    the microbial endophytes may be adapted to the complex metabolism of many
    desired molecules that can be of significant industrial applications. These
    microbes can be a useful alternative for sustainable solutions for
    ecological control of pests and diseases, and can reduce the burden of
    excess of chemical fertilizers for this purpose. This book is an attempt to
    review the recent development in the understanding of microbial endophytes
    and their potential biotechnological applications. This is a collection of
    literature authored by noted researchers having signatory status in
    endophytic research and summarizes the development achieved so far, and
    future prospects for further research in this fascinating area of research.

    Plant defense theory explores how plants invest in defenses against natural
    enemies but has focused primarily on the traits expressed by juvenile and
    mature plants. Here we describe the diverse ways in which seeds are
    chemically and physically defended. We suggest that through associations
    with other traits, seeds are likely to exhibit defense syndromes that
    reflect constraints or trade-offs imposed by selection to attract
    dispersers, enable effective dispersal, ensure appropriate timing of seed
    germination, and enhance seedling performance. We draw attention to seed and
    reproductive traits that are analogous to defense traits in mature plants
    and describe how the effectiveness of defenses is likely to differ at pre-
    and postdispersal stages. We also highlight recent insights into the
    mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between seeds and microbial
    communities, including fungi and endohyphal bacteria, that can influence
    seed survival in the soil and subsequent seedling vigor.

    Herbarium specimens represent important records of morphological and genetic
    diversity of plants that inform questions relevant to global change,
    including species distributions, phenology and functional traits. It is
    increasingly appreciated that plant microbiomes can influence these aspects
    of plant biology, but little is known regarding the historic distribution of
    microbes associated with plants collected in the pre-molecular age. If
    microbiomes can be observed reliably in herbarium specimens, researchers
    will gain a new lens with which to examine microbial ecology, evolution,
    species interactions. Here, we describe a method for accessing historical
    plant microbiomes from preserved herbarium specimens, providing a proof of
    concept using two plant taxa from the imperiled boreal biome (
                  Andromeda polifolia
                  and
                  Ledum palustre
                  subsp
                  . groenlandicum,
                  Ericaceae). We focus on fungal endophytes, which occur within symptomless plant tissues such as leaves. Through a three-part approach (i.e. culturing, cloning and next-generation amplicon sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform, with extensive controls), we examined endophyte communities in dried, pressed leaves that had been processed as regular herbarium specimens and stored at room temperature in a herbarium for four years
                  .
                  We retrieved only one endophyte in culture, but cloning and especially the MiSeq analysis revealed a rich community of foliar endophytes. The phylogenetic distribution and diversity of endophyte assemblages, especially among the Ascomycota, resemble endophyte communities from fresh plants collected in the boreal biome. We could distinguish communities of endophytes in each plant species and differentiate likely endophytes from fungi that could be surface contaminants. Taxa found by cloning were observed in the larger MiSeq dataset, but species richness was greater when subsets of the same tissues were evaluated with the MiSeq approach. Our findings provide a proof of concept for capturing endophyte DNA from herbarium specimens, supporting the importance of herbarium records as roadmaps for understanding the dynamics of plant-associated microbial biodiversity in the Anthropocene.
                
                This article is part of the theme issue ‘Biological collections for understanding biodiversity in the Anthropocene’.

    Fungal symbionts that live asymptomatically inside plant tissues
    (endophytes) can influence plant-insect interactions. Recent work has shown
    that damage by leaf-cutting ants, a major Neotropical defoliator, is reduced
    to almost half in plants with high densities of endophytes. We investigated
    changes in the phenotype of leaves that could influence ants' behavior to
    result in the reduction of foliar damage. We produced cucumber seedlings
    with high and low densities of one common endophyte species, Colletotrichum
    tropicale. We used the leaves in bioassays and to compare chemical and
    physical leaf characteristics important for ants' food selection. Ants cut
    about one-third more area of cucumber leaves with lower densities of
    endophytes and removed c. 20% more paper disks impregnated with the extracts
    of those leaves compared with leaves and disks from plants hosting the
    fungus. Colletotrichum tropicale colonization did not cause detectable
    changes in the composition of volatile compounds, cuticular waxes, nutrients
    or leaf toughness. Our study shows that endophytes changed leaf chemistry
    and suggests that compounds with relative low volatility released after leaf
    wounding are a major factor influencing foraging decisions by ants when
    choosing between plants with low or high endophyte loads. © 2013 New

    Summary
                
                  The flowering plants – angiosperms – appeared during the Early Cretaceous period and within 10–30 Myr dominated the species composition of many floras worldwide. Emerging insights into the phylogenetics of development and discoveries of early angiosperm fossils are shedding increased light on the patterns and processes of early angiosperm evolution. However, we also need to integrate ecology, in particular how early angiosperms established a roothold in pre‐existing Mesozoic plant communities. These events were critical in guiding subsequent waves of angiosperm diversification during the Aptian–Albian. Previous pictures of the early flowering plant ecology have been diverse, ranging from large tropical rainforest trees, weedy drought‐adapted and colonizing shrubs, disturbance‐ and sun‐loving rhizomatous herbs, and, more recently, aquatic herbs; however, none of these images were tethered to a robust hypothesis of angiosperm phylogeny. Here, we synthesize our current understanding of early angiosperm ecology, focusing on patterns of functional ecology, by merging recent molecular phylogenetic studies and functional studies on extant ‘basal angiosperms’ with the picture of early angiosperm evolution drawn by the fossil record.

    Methodological advances over the past two decades have propelled plant
    microbiome research, allowing the field to comprehensively test ideas
    proposed over a century ago and generate many new hypotheses. Studying the
    distribution of microbial taxa and genes across plant habitats has revealed
    the importance of various ecological and evolutionary forces shaping plant
    microbiota. In particular, selection imposed by plant habitats strongly
    shapes the diversity and composition of microbiota and leads to microbial
    adaptation associated with navigating the plant immune system and utilizing
    plant-derived resources. Reductionist approaches have demonstrated that the
    interaction between plant immunity and the plant microbiome is, in fact,
    bidirectional and that plants, microbiota, and the environment shape a
    complex chemical dialogue that collectively orchestrates the
    plantmicrobiome. The next stage in plant microbiome research will require
    the integration of ecological and reductionist approaches to establish a
    general understanding of the assembly and function in both natural and
    managed environments.

    Plants are rife with bacteria and fungi that colonize roots and shoots both
    externally and internally. By providing novel nutritional and defense
    pathways and influencing plant biochemical pathways, microbes can
    fundamentally alter plant phenotypes. Here we review the widespread nature
    of microbially mediated plant functional traits. We highlight that there is
    likely fitness conflict between hosts and symbionts and that fitness
    outcomes can depend on partner genotypes and ecological factors. Microbes
    may influence ecosystems through their effects on the functional trait
    values and population dynamics of their plant hosts. These effects may feed
    back on symbiont evolution by altering transmission rates of symbionts and
    scale up to ecosystem processes and services. We end by proposing new
    avenues of research in this emerging field.

    Research has demonstrated that intraspecific functional trait variation
    underpins plant responses to environmental variability. However, few studies
    have evaluated how trait variation shifts in response to plant pathogens,
    even though pathogens are a major driver of plant demography and diversity,
    and despite evidence of plants expressing distinct strategies in response to
    pathogen pressures. Understanding trait-pathogen relationships can provide a
    more realistic understanding of global patterns of functional trait
    variation. We examined leaf intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in
    response to foliar disease severity, using
                  Coffea arabica
                  cv. Caturra as a model species. We quantified coffee leaf rust (CLR) severity—a fungal disease prominent in coffee systems—and measured key coffee leaf functional traits under contrasting, but widespread, management conditions in an agroforestry system. We found that coffee plants express significant ITV, which is largely related to shade tree treatment and leaf position within coffee canopy strata. Yet within a single plant canopy stratum, CLR severity increased with increasing resource conserving trait values. However, coffee leaves with visible signs of disease expressed overall greater resource acquiring trait values, as compared to plants without visible signs of disease. We provide among the first evidence that leaf traits are correlated with foliar disease severity in coffee, and that functional trait relationships and syndromes shift in response to increased disease prevalence in this plant-pathogen system. In doing so, we address a vital gap in our understanding of global patterns of functional trait variation and highlight the need to further explore the potential role of pathogens within established global trait relationships and spectra.

    Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently
    colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and
    respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and
    microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical
    networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex
    interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains
    have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites
    with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological
    niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important
    source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this
    review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal
    terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids
    recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional
    medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight
    endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids,
    initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding
    endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the
    role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids
    provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and
    agriculture.

    What determines which plant species are susceptible to a given plant
    pathogen is poorly understood. Experimental inoculations with fungal
    pathogens of plant leaves in a tropical rain forest show that most fungal
    pathogens are polyphagous but that most plant species in a local community
    are resistant to any given pathogen. The likelihood that a pathogen can
    infect two plant species decreases continuously with phylogenetic distance
    between the plants, even to ancient evolutionary distances. This
    phylogenetic signal in host range allows us to predict the likely host range
    of plant pathogens in a local community, providing an important tool for
    plant ecology, design of agronomic systems, quarantine regulations in
    international trade, and risk analysis of biological control agents. In
    particular, the results suggest that the rate of spread and ecological
    impacts of a disease through a natural plant community will depend strongly
    on the phylogenetic structure of the community itself and that current
    regulatory approaches strongly underestimate the local risks of global
    movement of plant pathogens or their hosts.

    Abstract
                
                  Background
                  Metagenomics holds great promises for deepening our knowledge of key bacterial driven processes, but metagenome assembly remains problematic, typically resulting in representation biases and discarding significant amounts of non-redundant sequence information. In order to alleviate constraints assembly can impose on downstream analyses, and/or to increase the fraction of raw reads assembled via targeted assemblies relying on pre-assembly binning steps, we developed a set of binning modules and evaluated their combination in a new “assembly-free” binning protocol.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    We describe a scalable multi-tiered binning algorithm that combines frequency and compositional features to cluster unassembled reads, and demonstrate i) significant runtime performance gains of the developed modules against state of the art software, obtained through parallelization and the efficient use of large lock-free concurrent hash maps, ii) its relevance for clustering unassembled reads from high complexity (e.g., harboring 700 distinct genomes) samples, iii) its relevance to experimental setups involving multiple samples, through a use case consisting in the “de novo” identification of sequences from a target genome (e.g., a pathogenic strain) segregating at low levels in a cohort of 50 complex microbiomes (harboring 100 distinct genomes each), in the background of closely related strains and the absence of reference genomes, iv) its ability to correctly identify clusters of sequences from the
                    E. coli O104:H4
                    genome as the most strongly correlated to the infection status in 53 microbiomes sampled from the 2011 STEC outbreak in Germany, and to accurately cluster contigs of this pathogenic strain from a cross-assembly of these 53 microbiomes.
                  
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  
                    We present a set of sequence clustering (“binning”) modules and their application to biomarker (e.g., genomes of pathogenic organisms) discovery from large synthetic and real metagenomics datasets. Initially designed for the “assembly-free” analysis of individual metagenomic samples, we demonstrate their extension to setups involving multiple samples via the usage of the “alignment-free” d

    Abstract
                Fungal endophytes colonize living internal plant tissues without causing any visible symptoms of disease. Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaves may play an important role in the protection of hosts against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum . Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum , and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.

    Abstract
                
                  
                    
                      Despite the ubiquitous presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, mechanisms underlying variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are poorly understood. Given that endophytes in woody plants are predominantly horizontally transmitted, fungal endophyte colonization of foliar tissues is likely to be influenced by plant resistance traits. Here, we evaluated the association between leaf resistance traits and colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 10 dominant trees species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. Because resistance traits might restrict colonization of HTE, it was hypothesized that host trees with similar leaf resistance traits would show similar HTE communities.
                    
                    
                      We measured leaf traits with reported roles in plant resistance against pathogens and/or herbivores: cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids and chitinases. We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region.
                    
                    
                      
                        Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities. We found that host trees sharing leaf resistance traits harbour similar HTE communities. Fungal read counts decreased with increasing content of cell wall polysaccharides, while endophyte diversity decreased with increasing anthocyanin levels. Fungal read counts, in contrast, were positively associated with terpenoids. Additionally, culture‐based data indicated that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen

                        .
                      
                    
                    
                      
                        Synthesis
                        . Overall, we found that leaf resistance traits may influence fungal endophyte colonization and community composition in tree species, likely through deterrent effects of structural and chemical traits. We suggest that endophytic fungi that overcome resistance traits might play a role in plant protection.

    Abstract
                
                  
                    
                      Fungal endophytes (FE) are an important component of leaf microbial communities. They usually live asymptomatically within leaf tissues; however, FE can provide additional defensive features against microbial pathogens to the host. Leaf functional traits (LFTs) regulate FE entry, colonization and community composition in plants.
                    
                    
                      There is evidence that thin leaves with less structural and chemical traits but high nutrient content are more prone to FE colonization than well‐defended thick leaves. This illustrates the relevance of trade‐offs (= an increase in a trait, with a decrease in another trait) in LFTs, suggesting that the leaf economics spectrum (LES, which describes relationships in a suite of leaf traits aligned from a resource‐acquisitive to a resource‐conservative ecological strategy) may be a predictor of FE colonization and community composition in plants.
                    
                    
                      We hypothesize that LES‐modulated changes in the leaf internal environment (i.e. thin, low‐defended vs. thick, well‐defended leaves) will (a) have consequences for host resistance to pathogens due to changes in the FE colonization and diversity and, subsequently, in the foliar chemical profile and (b) may cause a switch in FE behaviour to a pathogenic lifestyle.
                    
                    
                      
                        Synthesis
                        . Still, our knowledge of how the coexistence between host plants and FE is regulated remains limited. LFTs may act as relevant ecological hub of FE colonization, community composition and life behaviour in natural ecosystems, with potential bottom‐up effects on other organisms, including pathogens. We highlight and discuss critical aspects in this topic and end by proposing new avenues of research in this emerging field.

    One of the major impacts of climate change is increasing global
    temperatures. Because warming is expected to affect plant morphological and
    chemical traits, it may therefore also influence plant interactions with
    other trophic levels, including herbivores. Here, we simulated a climate
    warming scenario of +2.7°C in the field using open-top chambers and assessed
    the effects of warming on plant performance (growth, leaf area, and
    chlorophyll), leaf nutrients (nitrogen and carbon), and primary (amino acids
    and carbohydrates) and secondary (toxic aristolochic acids) metabolites in
    the plant
                  Aristolochia chilensis
                  . We performed untargeted metabolomics analyses for estimating general changes in foliar metabolites between ambient control and warming-treated plants. Bioassays were additionally conducted to evaluate how changes in host plant chemistry affected growth and nutritional parameters in first-instar larvae of the specialist lepidopteran herbivore
                  Battus polydamas archidamas
                  . We found that warming did not significantly affect plant performance, but did result in significant changes in leaf nutrients, and primary and secondary metabolites, although in opposite directions. While primary metabolites (specifically, nitrogen-containing compounds) decreased in response to treatment, aristolochic acids increased. Untargeted metabolomics analyses showed that, of a total of 824 features, 50 were significantly different between ambient control and warming-treated plants; some of these were identified by MS/MS spectra as amino acids. Larvae feeding on warming-treated plants, showed significantly enhanced growth, food conversion efficiency, and lipid concentration. Our study contributes to current understanding of climate change impacts on trophic interactions, showing that projected temperature increases lead to changes in the resistance phenotype of the host plant, favoring nutrition and growth of a unique specialist herbivore.

    Summary
                The interiors of plants are colonized by diverse microorganisms that are referred to as endophytes. Endophytes have received much attention over the past few decades, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding patterns in their biodiversity at local to global scales. To characterize research effort to date, we synthesized results from ~600 published studies. Our survey revealed a global research interest and highlighted several gaps in knowledge. For instance, of the 17 biomes encompassed by our survey, 7 were understudied and together composed only 7% of the studies that we considered. We found that fungal endophyte diversity has been characterized in at least one host from 30% of embryophyte families, while bacterial endophytes have been surveyed in hosts from only 10.5% of families. We complimented our survey with a vote counting procedure to determine endophyte richness patterns among plant tissue types. We found that variation in endophyte assemblages in above‐ground tissues varied with host growth habit. Stems were the richest tissue in woody plants, whereas roots were the richest tissue in graminoids. For forbs, we found no consistent differences in relative tissue richness among studies. We propose future directions to fill the gaps in knowledge we uncovered and inspire further research.

    Plant-symbiotic fungi influence the structure and function of all
    terrestrial ecosystems, but factors shaping their distributions in time and
    space are rarely well understood. Grasses (Poaceae), which first arose and
    diversified in tropical forests, harbor diverse but little-studied
    endophytes in the lowland forests of Panama. We used sequence data for 402
    isolates from two sampling years, 11 host species, and 55 microsites at
    Barro Colorado Island, Panama to investigate the influence of host and
    habitat (soil type, forest age) in shaping endophyte diversity and
    composition. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for host-
    or habitat specificity. Instead, endophytes demonstrated strong spatial
    structure consistent with dispersal limitation, with community similarity
    decaying markedly over a scale of hundreds of meters. Spatial structure that
    is independent of host species and habitat reveals remarkable heterogeneity
    of endophyte-host associations at small geographic scales and adds an
    important spatial component to extrapolative estimates of fungal diversity.

    Insect herbivory is a major driving force of plant evolution. Phenotypic
    plasticity and developmental variation provide a means for plants to cope
    with variable herbivory. We characterized the genetics of developmental
    variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative
    defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are
    evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable
    predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We
    found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected
    trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to
    produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves,
    regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of
    producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on
    trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL)
    by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived
    from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL
    influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive,
    developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced
    trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a
    central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this
    location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome
    production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

    Phylogenies are a central and indispensable tool for evolutionary and
    ecological research. Even though most angiosperm families are well
    investigated from a phylogenetic point of view, there are far less
    possibilities to carry out large-scale meta-analyses at order level or
    higher. Here, we reconstructed a large-scale dated phylogeny including
    nearly 1/8th of all angiosperm species, based on two plastid barcoding
    genes,
                  matK
                  (incl.
                  trnK
                  ) and
                  rbcL.
                  Novel sequences were generated for several species, while the rest of the data were mined from GenBank. The resulting tree was dated using 56 angiosperm fossils as calibration points. The resulting megaphylogeny is one of the largest dated phylogenetic tree of angiosperms yet, consisting of 36,101 sampled species, representing 8,399 genera, 426 families and all orders. This novel framework will be useful for investigating different broad scale research questions in ecological and evolutionary biology.

    How cellulose‐based leaf toughness and lamina density contribute to long
    leaf lifespans of shade‐tolerant species

    Background and AimsLeaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history
    trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data
    are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light
    environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during
    the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and
    stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and
    seedling survival.MethodsData from three experiments encompassing 104
    neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein
    fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were
    quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages
    in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded
    understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally
    recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from
    1994 to 2011.Key ResultsMedian leaf life span ranged widely among species,
    always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to >1790 d in the understorey and
    shade houses) than in gaps (115-867 d), but with strong correlation between
    gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age,
    whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these
    traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and
    stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade,
    while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.ConclusionsThe
    wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects
    variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees,
    shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is
    important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf
    life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be
    considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in
    tropical forest understoreys. © The Author 2013.

    The assembly of DNA barcode libraries is particularly relevant within
    species-rich natural communities for which accurate species identifications
    will enable detailed ecological forensic studies. In addition, well-resolved
    molecular phylogenies derived from these DNA barcode sequences have the
    potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community
    assembly and functional trait evolution. To date, no studies have
    effectively applied DNA barcodes
                  sensu strictu
                  in this manner. In this report, we demonstrate that a three-locus DNA barcode when applied to 296 species of woody trees, shrubs, and palms found within the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, resulted in >98% correct identifications. These DNA barcode sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community phylogeny employing a supermatrix method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the plot. The three-locus barcode data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the plot that are congruent with the broadly accepted phylogeny of flowering plants (APG II). Earlier work on the phylogenetic structure of the BCI forest dynamics plot employing less resolved phylogenies reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological inferences compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community phylogenies may have increased type I and type II errors. These results illustrate how highly resolved phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and evolution.

    Variation in atmospheric [CO
                  2
                  ] is a prominent feature of the environmental history over which vascular plants have evolved. Periods of falling and low [CO
                  2
                  ] in the palaeo-record appear to have created selective pressure for important adaptations in modern plants. Today, rising [CO
                  2
                  ] is a key component of anthropogenic global environmental change that will impact plants and the ecosystem goods and services they deliver. Currently, there is limited evidence that natural plant populations have evolved in response to contemporary increases in [CO
                  2
                  ] in ways that increase plant productivity or fitness, and no evidence for incidental breeding of crop varieties to achieve greater yield enhancement from rising [CO
                  2
                  ]. Evolutionary responses to elevated [CO
                  2
                  ] have been studied by applying selection in controlled environments, quantitative genetics and trait-based approaches. Findings to date suggest that adaptive changes in plant traits in response to future [CO
                  2
                  ] will not be consistently observed across species or environments and will not be large in magnitude compared with physiological and ecological responses to future [CO
                  2
                  ]. This lack of evidence for strong evolutionary effects of elevated [CO
                  2
                  ] is surprising, given the large effects of elevated [CO
                  2
                  ] on plant phenotypes. New studies under more stressful, complex environmental conditions associated with climate change may revise this view. Efforts are underway to engineer plants to: (i) overcome the limitations to photosynthesis from today's [CO
                  2
                  ] and (ii) benefit maximally from future, greater [CO
                  2
                  ]. Targets range in scale from manipulating the function of a single enzyme (e.g. Rubisco) to adding metabolic pathways from bacteria as well as engineering the structural and functional components necessary for C

                  photosynthesis into C

                  ].

    We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of
    individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for
    multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to
    base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are
    ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based
    hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of
    interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method
    of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on
    Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of
    principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1)
    calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure
    of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates
    (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which
    preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables
    corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a
    linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal
    coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and
    (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics
    corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain
    advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We
    demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from
    intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate
    interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will
    be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to
    structured multifactorial experimental designs.

    Summary 1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in
    redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes
    represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along
    the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted
    through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped
    from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in
    computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are
    compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical
    axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect
    (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those
    corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The
    ‘marginal’ testing method implemented in the ‘vegan’ R package and the
    ‘forward’ testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to
    have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the
    residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R
    functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal
    description of the ‘marginal’ and ‘forward’ testing methods.

    The book describes and discusses the numerical methods which are
    successfully being used for analysing ecological data, using a clear and
    comprehensive approach. These methods are derived from the fields of
    mathematical physics, parametric and nonparametric statistics, information
    theory, numerical taxonomy, archaeology, psychometry, sociometry, econometry
    and others. Relates ecological questions to methods of statistical analysis,
    with a clear description of complex numerical methods. All methods are
    illustrated by examples from the ecological literature so that ecologists
    clearly see how to use the methods and approaches in their own research. All
    calculations are available in R language functions

    Abstract
                
                  The genus
                  Calonectria
                  includes many aggressive plant pathogens causing diseases on various agricultural crops as well as forestry and ornamental tree species. Some species have been accidentally introduced into new environments via international trade of putatively asymptomatic plant germplasm or contaminated soil, resulting in significant economic losses. This review provides an overview of the taxonomy, population biology, and pathology of
                  Calonectria
                  species, specifically emerging from contemporary studies that have relied on DNA‐based technologies. The growing importance of genomics in future research is highlighted. A life cycle is proposed for
                  Calonectria
                  species, aimed at improving our ability to manage diseases caused by these pathogens.

    Leaf defenses have long been studied in the context of plant growth rate,
    resource availability, and optimal investment theory. Likewise, one of the
    central modern paradigms of plant ecophysiology, the leaf economics spectrum
    (LES), has been extensively studied in the context of these factors across
    ecological scales ranging from global species data sets to temporal shifts
    within individuals. Despite strong physiological links between LES strategy
    and leaf defenses in structure, function, and resource investment, the
    relationship between these trait classes has not been well explored. This
    study investigates the relationship between leaf defenses and LES strategy
    across whole-plant ontogeny in three diverse Helianthus species known to
    exhibit dramatic ontogenetic shifts in LES strategy, focusing primarily on
    physical and quantitative chemical defenses. Plants were grown under
    controlled environmental conditions and sampled for LES and defense traits
    at four ontogenetic stages. Defenses were found to shift strongly with
    ontogeny, and to correlate strongly with LES strategy. More advanced
    ontogenetic stages with more conservative LES strategy leaves had higher
    tannin activity and toughness in all species, and higher leaf dry matter
    content in two of three species. Modeling results in two species support the
    conclusion that changes in defenses drive changes in LES strategy through
    ontogeny, and in one species that changes in defenses and LES strategy are
    likely independently driven by ontogeny. Results of this study support the
    hypothesis that leaf-level allocation to defenses might be an important
    determinant of leaf economic traits, where high investment in defenses
    drives a conservative LES strategy.

    Nonparametric multivariate analysis of ecological data using permutation
    tests has two main challenges: (1) to partition the variability in the data
    according to a complex design or model, as is often required in ecological
    experiments, and (2) to base the analysis on a multivariate distance measure
    (such as the semimetric Bray-Curtis measure) that is reasonable for
    ecological data sets. Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one
    or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to
    Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based
    redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating
    principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues,
    if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here
    that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved
    directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no
    eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An
    ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical
    methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real
    ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial
    designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with
    the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an
    exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.

    There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever
    produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but
    that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species
    interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community
    ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together
    by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional
    traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the
    interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized
    niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this
    approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more
    readily address issues of global change. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

    Fungal endophytes isolated from healthy Theobroma cacao tissues were
    screened in vitro for antagonism against major pathogens of cacao. Of tested
    endophytic morphospecies, 40% (21/52), 65% (28/43) and 27% percent (4/15)
    showed in vitro antagonism against Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot),
    Phytophthora palmivora (black pod rot) and Moniliophthora perniciosa
    (witches broom), respectively. The most common antagonistic mechanism was
    simple competition for substrate. Nonetheless, 13%, 21%, and 0% of tested
    morphospecies showed clear antibiosis against M. roreri, P. palmivora, and
    M. perniciosa, respectively. One isolate of Trichoderma was observed to be
    parasitic on M. roreri. Endophyte species that were common in the host
    plants under natural conditions often are good colonizers and grow fast in
    vitro whereas antibiosis producers usually appear to be relatively rare in
    nature, tend to grow slowly in vitro, and often are not good colonizers. We
    suggest that there is an inherent general trade-off between fast growth
    (high colonization) and production of chemicals that produce antibiosis
    reactions. Finally, field trials assessing the effects of three endophytic
    fungi (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Clonostachys rosea and Botryosphaeria
    ribis) on pod loss due to M. roreri and Phytophthora spp. were conducted at
    four farms in Panama. Although the overall incidence of black pod rot was
    very low during the tests, treatment with C. gloeosporioides significantly
    decreased pod loss due to that disease. We observed no decrease in pod loss
    due to frosty pod rot, but treatment with C. rosea reduced the incidence of
    cacao pods with sporulating lesions of M. roreri by 10%. The observed
    reduction in pod loss due to Phytophthora spp., and sporulation by M.
    roreri, supports the potential of fungal endophytes as biological control
    agents. Further, these studies suggest that combined information from field
    censuses of endophytic fungi, in vitro studies, and greenhouse experiments
    can provide useful a priori criteria for identifying desirable attributes
    for potential biocontrol agents. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants,
    vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts
    that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary
    success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well
    as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed
    under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) in their leaf
    tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on
    their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEF reduce pathogen and
    herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two
    physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic
    effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts.
    Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E-) Theobroma cacao leaves with
    Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEF species in healthy T. cacao,
    induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes,
    including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited
    increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of
    photosynthesis (Amax), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes.
    These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in
    expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a
    cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers
    resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products
    in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+
    plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense
    responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced
    photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy
    of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte
    interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of
    genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.

    A taxonomic revision is provided for Cordiaceae (Boraginales) in Mexico and
    Central America and the adjacent portions of the United States, including 44
    species of Cordia and 17 species of Varronia. Eight of the 44 species of
    Cordia were described as new to science elsewhere in earlier parts of this
    study. Cordiaceae are distinguished from other families of Boraginales in
    being erect woody plants with a style that is twice-divided with four
    stigmas. Taxonomic history of generic delimitation in the Cordiaceae is
    presented, along with discussions of morphology of Cordia and Varronia, an
    overview of breeding systems in the family, provisional conservation
    assessments, infrageneric classification, keys to species, and descriptions,
    with complete nomenclature and notes on geographic distribution and how to
    recognize individual species.

    Abstract
                IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org, last accessed February 6, 2020) is a user-friendly and widely used software package for phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood. Since the release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable features of IQ-TREE version 2 and highlight the key advantages over other software.

    Angiosperm leaves manifest a remarkable diversity of shapes that range from
    developmental sequences within a shoot and within crown response to
    microenvironment to variation among species within and between communities
    and among orders or families. It is generally assumed that because
    photosynthetic leaves are critical to plant growth and survival, variation
    in their shape reflects natural selection operating on function. Several
    non-mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain leaf shape
    diversity. These include: thermoregulation of leaves especially in arid and
    hot environments, hydraulic constraints, patterns of leaf expansion in
    deciduous species, biomechanical constraints, adaptations to avoid
    herbivory, adaptations to optimise light interception and even that leaf
    shape variation is a response to selection on flower form. However, the
    relative importance, or likelihood, of each of these factors is unclear.
    Here we review the evolutionary context of leaf shape diversification,
    discuss the proximal mechanisms that generate the diversity in extant
    systems, and consider the evidence for each the above hypotheses in the
    context of the functional significance of leaf shape. The synthesis of these
    broad ranging areas helps to identify points of conceptual convergence for
    ongoing discussion and integrated directions for future research.

    Abstract Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a
    foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is
    structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with
    seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less
    seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal
    forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend
    to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves—fungal endophytes—that influence plant
    health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests
    across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic
    factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with
    temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic
    composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual
    temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital
    role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these
    important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the
    foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.

    We compared the leaf traits and plant performance of 53 co-occurring tree
    species in a semi-evergreen tropical moist forest community. The species
    differed in all leaf traits analyzed: leaf life span varied 11-fold among
    species, specific leaf area 5-fold, mass-based nitrogen 3-fold, mass-based
    assimilation rate 13-fold, mass-based respiration rate 15-fold, stomatal
    conductance 8-fold, and photosynthetic water use efficiency 4-fold.
    Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area
    predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span
    predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely
    associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf
    investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon
    gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to
    variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good
    predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory.
    High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically
    active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the
    formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by
    herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay
    this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically
    active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf
    traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a
    continuum in species' light requirements.

    Endophytes are microorganisms that live within plant tissues without causing
    symptoms of disease. They are important components of plant microbiomes.
    Endophytes interact with, and overlap in function with, other core microbial
    groups that colonize plant tissues, e.g., mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens,
    epiphytes, and saprotrophs. Some fungal endophytes affect plant growth and
    plant responses to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental change; others
    produce useful or interesting secondary metabolites. Here, we focus on new
    techniques and approaches that can provide an integrative understanding of
    the role of fungal endophytes in the plant microbiome. Clavicipitaceous
    endophytes of grasses are not considered because they have unique properties
    distinct from other endophytes. Hidden from view and often overlooked,
    endophytes are emerging as their diversity, importance for plant growth and
    survival, and interactions with other organisms are revealed.

    Summary
                
                  
                    
                      The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade‐off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.
                    
                    
                      Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).
                    
                    
                      There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole‐plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.
                    
                    
                      Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait‐based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.
                    
                    
                      
                        Synthesis
                        . Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.

    Interactions between leaf-cutting ants, their fungal symbiont (
                  Leucoagaricus
                  ) and the endophytic fungi within the vegetation they carry into their colonies are still poorly understood. If endophytes antagonistic to
                  Leucoagaricus
                  were found in plant material being carried by these ants, then this might indicate a potential mechanism for plants to defend themselves from leaf-cutter attack. In addition, it could offer possibilities for the management of these important Neotropical pests. Here, we show that, for
                  Atta sexdens rubropilosa
                  , there was a significantly greater incidence of
                  Trichoderma
                  species in the vegetation removed from the nests—and deposited around the entrances—than in that being transported into the nests. In a no-choice test,
                  Trichoderma-
                  infested rice was taken into the nest, with deleterious effects on both the fungal gardens and ant survival. The endophytic ability of selected strains of
                  Trichoderma
                  was also confirmed, following their inoculation and subsequent reisolation from seedlings of eucalyptus. These results indicate that endophytic fungi which pose a threat to ant fungal gardens through their antagonistic traits, such as
                  Trichoderma
                  , have the potential to act as bodyguards of their plant hosts and thus might be employed in a Trojan-horse strategy to mitigate the negative impact of leaf-cutting ants in both agriculture and silviculture in the Neotropics. We posit that the ants would detect and evict such ‘malign’ endophytes—artificially inoculated into vulnerable crops—during the quality-control process within the nest, and, moreover, that the foraging ants may then be deterred from further harvesting of ‘
                  Trichoderma
                  -enriched’ plants.

    All plants in natural ecosystems appear to be symbiotic with fungal
    endophytes. This highly diverse group of fungi can have profound impacts on
    plant communities through increasing fitness by conferring abiotic and
    biotic stress tolerance, increasing biomass and decreasing water
    consumption, or decreasing fitness by altering resource allocation. Despite
    more than 100 yr of research resulting in thousands of journal articles, the
    ecological significance of these fungi remains poorly characterized.
    Historically, two endophytic groups (clavicipitaceous (C) and
    nonclavicipitaceous (NC)) have been discriminated based on phylogeny and
    life history traits. Here, we show that NC-endophytes represent three
    distinct functional groups based on host colonization and transmission, in
    planta biodiversity and fitness benefits conferred to hosts. Using this
    framework, we contrast the life histories, interactions with hosts and
    potential roles in plant ecophysiology of C- and NC-endophytes, and
    highlight several key questions for future work in endophyte biology. © 2009

    Background
                  VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.
                
                
                  Methods
                  When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or
                    de novo
                    ), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at
                    https://github.com/torognes/vsearch
                    under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0.
                  
                
                
                  Discussion
                  VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.

    In recent decades, commercial
                  Eucalyptus
                  plantations have expanded toward the warm and humid regions of northern and northeastern Brazil, where
                  Calonectria
                  leaf blight (CLB) has become the primary fungal leaf disease of this crop. CLB can be caused by different
                  Calonectria
                  species, and previous studies have indicated that
                  Calonectria
                  might have high species diversity in Brazil. During a disease survey conducted in three commercial plantations of
                  Eucalyptus
                  in northeastern Brazil, diseased leaves from
                  Eucalyptus
                  trees with typical symptoms of CLB were collected, and

    The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for
    explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its
    central tenet - that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics
    and at high densities - assumes a degree of host specialization in
    interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC
    effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and
    saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil
    and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important
    antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical
    forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are
    structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of
    factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1-
    12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed
    viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed
    viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of
    reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their
    persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings
    and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are
    based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context
    of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have
    emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical
    forests.

    Abstract
                All plants, including crop species, harbor a community of fungal endophyte species, yet we know little about the biotic factors that are important in endophyte community assembly. We suggest that the most direct route to understanding the mechanisms underlying community assembly is through the study of functional trait variation in the host and its fungal consortium. We review studies on crop endophytes that investigate plant and fungal traits likely to be important in endophyte community processes. We focus on approaches that could speed detection of general trends in endophyte community assembly: (i) use of the ‘assembly rules’ concept to identify specific mechanisms that influence endophyte community dynamics, (ii) measurement of functional trait variation in plants and fungi to better understand endophyte community processes and plant–fungal interactions, and (iii) investigation of microbe–microbe interactions, and fungal traits that mediate them. This approach is well suited for research in agricultural systems, where pair‐wise host–fungus interactions and mechanisms of fungal–fungal competition have frequently been described. Areas for consideration include the possibility that human manipulation of crop phenotype and deployment of fungal biocontrol species can significantly influence endophyte community assembly. Evaluation of endophyte assembly rules may help to fine‐tune crop management strategies.

    Several hypotheses, mainly Optimal Defense (OD), Carbon:Nutrient Balance
    (CNB), Growth Rate (GR), and Growth-Differentiation Balance (GDB), have
    individually served as frameworks for investigating the patterns of plant
    defense against herbivores, in particular the pattern of constitutive
    defense. The predictions and tests of these hypotheses have been problematic
    for a variety of reasons and have led to considerable confusion about the
    state of the "theory of plant defense." The primary contribution of the OD
    hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of
    genotypic expression of plant defense, with the emphasis on allocation cost
    of defense. The primary contribution of the CNB hypothesis is that it has
    served as the main framework for investigation of how resources affect
    phenotypic expression of plant defense, often with studies concerned about
    allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the GR hypothesis is
    that it explains how intrinsic growth rate of plants shaped evolutionarily
    by resource availability affects defensive patterns. The primary
    contribution of the expanded GDB hypothesis is that it recognizes the
    constant physiological tradeoff between growth and differentiation at the
    cellular and tissue levels relative to the selective pressures of resource
    availability, including explicitly taking into account plant tolerance of
    damage by enemies. A clearer understanding of these hypotheses and what we
    have learned from investigations that use them can facilitate development of
    well-designed experiments that address the gaps in our knowledge of plant
    defense.

    The aerial surface of plants, known as the phyllosphere, represents a
    widespread and diverse habitat for microbes, but the fungal communities
    colonizing the surface of leaves are not well characterized, and how these
    communities are assembled on hosts is unknown. We used high-throughput
    sequencing of fungal communities on the leaves of 51 tree species in a
    lowland tropical rainforest in Panama to examine the influence of host plant
    taxonomy and traits on the fungi colonizing the phyllosphere. Fungal
    communities on leaves were dominated by the phyla Ascomycota (79% of all
    sequences), Basidiomycota (11%), and Chytridiomycota (5%). Host plant
    taxonomic identity explained more than half of the variation in fungal
    community composition across trees, and numerous host functional traits
    related to leaf morphology, leaf chemistry, and plant growth and mortality
    were significantly associated with fungal community structure. Differences
    in fungal biodiversity among hosts suggest that individual tree species

    Vascular epiphytes contribute up to 35% of the plant diversity and foliar
    biomass of flowering plants. The family Bromeliaceae is a monophyletic group
    of plants native to the Neotropics. Epiphytic bromeliads form associations
    with distinct groups of organisms but their relationship with foliar fungal
    endophytes remain underexplored. In this study we examined the relationship
    of foliar fungal endophytes to host photosynthetic pathways and associated
    ecophysiological traits. We sampled the fungal endophyte communities of 67
    host individuals in six epiphytic bromeliad species differing in C3 and
    crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathways. We tested
    whether endophyte assemblages were associated with ecophysiological leaf
    traits related to host photosynthetic pathways. Our results indicate that
    (1) C3 and CAM bromeliads host dissimilar endophyte assemblages, (2)
    endophyte communities in C3 bromeliads are characterized by variable
    relative abundances of fungal orders; conversely, CAM associated endophyte
    communities were characterized by consistent relative abundances of fungal
    orders, and (3) endophyte communities in bromeliads are distributed along a
    continuum of leaf toughness and leaf water content. Taken together, our
    study suggests that host physiology and associated ecophysiological traits
    of epiphytic bromeliads may represent biotic filters for communities of
    fungal endophytes in the tropics.

    Leaf traits of plants worldwide are classified according to the Leaf
    Economics Spectrum (LES), which links leaf functional traits to evolutionary
    life history strategies. As a continuum ranging from thicker, tough leaves
    that are low in nitrogen (N) to thinner, softer, leaves that are high in N,
    the LES brings together physical, chemical, and ecological traits. Fungal
    endophytes are common foliar symbionts that occur in healthy, living leaves,
    especially in tropical forests. Their community composition often differs
    among co-occurring host species in ways that cannot be explained by
    environmental conditions or host phylogenetic relationships. Here, we tested
    the over-arching hypothesis that LES traits act as habitat filters that
    shape communities of endophytes both in terms of composition, and in terms
    of selecting for endophytes with particular suites of functional traits. We
    used culture-based and culture-free surveys to characterize foliar
    endophytes in mature leaves of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species
    with divergent LES traits in lowland Panama, and then measured functional
    traits of dominant endophyte taxa in vitro . Endophytes were less abundant
    and less diverse in thick, tough, leaves compared to thin, softer, leaves in
    the same forest, even in closely related plants. Endophyte communities
    differed according to leaf traits, including leaf punch strength and carbon
    and nitrogen content. The most common endophyte taxa in leaves at different
    ends of the LES differ in their cellulase, protease, chitinase, and
    antipathogen activity. Our results extend the LES framework for the first
    time to diverse and ecologically important endophytes, opening new
    hypotheses regarding the degree to which foliar symbionts respond to, and
    extend, the functional traits of leaves they inhabit.

    Phylogenetic analyses can provide a wealth of information about the past
    demography of a population and the level of genetic diversity within and
    between species. By using special computer programs developed in recent
    years, large amounts of data have been produced in the molecular genetics
    area. To analyze these data, powerful new methods based on large
    computations have been applied in various software packages and programs.
    But these programs have their own specific input and output formats, and
    users need to create different input formats for almost every program. R is
    an open source software environment, and it supports open contribution and
    modification to its libraries. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform
    several analyses using a single input file format. In this article, by using
    the multiple sequences FASTA format file (.fas extension) we demonstrate and
    share a workflow of how to extract haplotypes and perform phylogenetic
    analyses and visualizations in R. As an example dataset, we used 120
                  Bombus terrestris dalmatinus
                  mitochondrial cytochrome

                  Premise of the study:
                  Endophytic and endolichenic fungi occur in healthy tissues of plants and lichens, respectively, playing potentially important roles in the ecology and evolution of their hosts. However, previous sampling has not comprehensively evaluated the biotic, biogeographic, and abiotic factors that structure their communities.
                
                
                  •
                  Methods:
                  Using molecular data we examined the diversity, composition, and distributions of 4154 endophytic and endolichenic Ascomycota cultured from replicate surveys of ca. 20 plant and lichen species in each of five North American sites (Madrean coniferous forest, Arizona; montane semideciduous forest, North Carolina; scrub forest, Florida; Beringian tundra and forest, western Alaska; subalpine tundra, eastern central Alaska).
                
                
                  •
                  Key results:
                  Endolichenic fungi were more abundant and diverse per host species than endophytes, but communities of endophytes were more diverse overall, reflecting high diversity in mosses and lycophytes. Endophytes of vascular plants were largely distinct from fungal communities that inhabit mosses and lichens. Fungi from closely related hosts from different regions were similar in higher taxonomy, but differed at shallow taxonomic levels. These differences reflected climate factors more strongly than geographic distance alone.
                
                
                  •
                  Conclusions:
                  Our study provides a first evaluation of endophytic and endolichenic fungal associations with their hosts at a continental scale. Both plants and lichens harbor abundant and diverse fungal communities whose incidence, diversity, and composition reflect the interplay of climatic patterns, geographic separation, host type, and host lineage. Although culture‐free methods will inform future work, our study sets the stage for empirical assessments of ecological specificity, metabolic capability, and comparative genomics.

    Many organisms participate in symbiotic relationships with other organisms,
    yet studies of symbioses typically have focused on the reciprocal costs and
    benefits within a particular host-symbiont pair. Recent studies indicate
    that many ecological interactions involve alliances of symbionts acting
    together as mutualistic consortia against other consortia. Such interacting
    consortia are likely to be widespread in nature, even if the interactions
    often occur in a cryptic fashion. Little theory and empirical data exist
    concerning how these complex interactions shape ecological outcomes in
    nature. Here, we review recent work on fungal-fungal interactions between
    two consortia: (i) leaf-cutting ants and their symbiotic fungi (the latter
    grown as a food crop by the former) and (ii) tropical plants and their
    foliar endophytes (the cryptic symbiotic fungi within leaves of the former).
    Plant characteristics (e.g., secondary compounds or leaf physical properties
    of leaves) are involved in leaf-cutting ant preferences, and a synthesis of
    published information suggests that these plant traits could be modified by
    fungal presence. We discuss potential mechanisms for how fungal-fungal
    interactions proceed in the leaf-cutting ant agriculture and suggest themes
    for future research.

    Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we
    describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf
    economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological
    properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of
    nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of
    growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum
    would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale
    better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap
    substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and
    trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some
    striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of
    the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove
    valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under
    changing land-use and climate.

    Due to increasingly limited water resources, diminishing farmland acreage,
    and potentially negative effects of climate change, an urgent need exists to
    improve agricultural productivity to feed the ever-growing population.
    Plants interact with microorganisms at all trophic levels, adapting growth,
    developmental, and defense responses within a complicated network of
    community members. Endophytic fungi have been widely reported for their
    ability to aid in the defense of their host plants. Currently, many reports
    focus on the application of endophytic fungi with the capability to produce
    valuable bioactive molecules, while others focus on endophytic fungi as
    biocontrol agents. Plant responses upon endophytic fungi colonization are
    also good for the immune system of the plant. In this paper, the possible
    mechanisms between endophytic fungi and their hosts were reviewed. During
    long-term evolution, plants have acquired numerous beneficial strategies in
    response to endophytic fungi colonization. The interaction of endophytic
    fungi with plants modulates the relationship between plants and both biotic
    and abiotic stresses. It has previously been reported that this endophytic
    relationship confers additional defensive mechanisms on the modulation of
    the plant immune system, as the result of the manipulation of direct
    antimicrobial metabolites such as alkaloids to indirect phytohormones,
    jasmonic acid, or salicylic acid. Furthermore, plants have evolved to cope
    with combinations of stresses and experiments are required to address
    specific questions related to these multiple stresses. This review
    summarizes our current understanding of the intrinsic mechanism to better
    utilize these benefits for plant growth and disease resistance. It
    contributes new ideas to increase plant fitness and crop productivity.

  abstract: "Abstract\n            \n              Angiosperms are the cornerstone of most terrestrial ecosystems and human livelihoods\n              1,2\n              . A robust understanding of angiosperm evolution is required to explain their rise to ecological dominance. So far, the angiosperm tree of life has been determined primarily by means of analyses of the plastid genome\n              3,4\n              . Many studies have drawn on this foundational work, such as classification and first insights into angiosperm diversification since their Mesozoic origins\n              5–7\n              . However, the limited and biased sampling of both taxa and genomes undermines confidence in the tree and its implications. Here, we build the tree of life for almost 8,000 (about 60%) angiosperm genera using a standardized set of 353 nuclear genes\n              8\n              . This 15-fold increase in genus-level sampling relative to comparable nuclear studies\n              9\n              provides a critical test of earlier results and brings notable\_change to key groups, especially in rosids, while substantiating many previously predicted relationships. Scaling this tree to time using 200 fossils, we discovered that early angiosperm evolution was characterized by high gene tree conflict and explosive diversification, giving rise to more than 80% of extant angiosperm orders. Steady diversification ensued through the remaining Mesozoic Era until rates resurged in the Cenozoic Era, concurrent with decreasing global temperatures and tightly linked with gene tree conflict. Taken together, our extensive sampling combined with advanced phylogenomic methods shows the deep history and full complexity in the evolution of a megadiverse clade."
