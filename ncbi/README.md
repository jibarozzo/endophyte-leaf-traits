# Using NCBI Datasets

To replicate these results you will need to download PCR negatives and DNA Blanks from the `Aim3_Original_Sample_gzip_files`. The sample files are found in the NCBI database under [BioProject PRJNA1162076](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1162076/). After that, organize your repository as best you see fit and perform bioinformatic and statistical analyses.
